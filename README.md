# Snap-Political-Ads-Analysis
This project will explore spending on political ads on Snapchat

I set out on the project with the idea that I would compare spending on political advertisements by the Harris and Trump, but I was surprised to realize that the Trump campaign had not yet spent ANY money on the platform.

As a result, the focus of this project to just learning what I could about how the Harris campaign spends money on the platform.
